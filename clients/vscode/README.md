# Objeck LSP

Visual Studio Code Objeck LSP client/server and syntax highlighter.

## Running client

* Edit the 'package.json' file in the '%HOMEPATH%/.vscode/extensions/objeck-lsp.objeck-lsp-xxx/package.json' or '~/.vscode/extensions/objeck-lsp.objeck-lsp-xxx/package.json' directory so it points to the Objeck install directory. Depending upon your platform edit the 'objk.win.install.dir' for Windows or 'objk.posix.install.dir' for macOS and Linux.
* Open a \*.obs source file or a workspace containing \*.obs files and a build.json files (see below)

## Workspaces

Workspaces allow the LSP to build and scan all files within a project configuration. This feature supports solutions that span multiple files or require specific libraries to be built and inspected correctly.

1. To set up projects with multiple files, create a "build.json" file in the directory of the files you want to be scanned.
2. The structure of the "build.json" file is as follows:
```
{
  "files": [
    "file_1.obs",
    "file_2.obs"
  ],
  "libs": [
    "gen_collect.obl",
    "regex.obl",
    "net.obl",
    "json.obl",
    "misc.obl"
  ],
  "flags": ""
}
```
3. To enable the project file, Close all open files and open the directory that contains the "build.json" file in either VS Code or Sublime
